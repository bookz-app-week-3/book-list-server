# Project Name

**Author**: Joel Clair and Kerry Nordstrom
**Version**: 1.4.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- This server side environment serves to create a controller to query our database of books and communicate this information to our View level on the client side.  It does this via methods from the Express and cors libraries, with database support from postgreSQL -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user must set up their node.js server environment and a postgreSQL database environment. -->

## Architecture
<!-- Our data lives in a postgreSQL schema and loads via linked SQL queries within our server.js file.  The user will eventually see the queried books on the client side via routes set up in this file. -->

## Change Log
