**Author**: Joel Clair and Kerry Nordstrom
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- This server side environment serves to create a controller to query our database of books and communicate this information to our View level on the client side.  It does this via methods from the Express and cors libraries, with database support from postgreSQL -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user must set up their node.js server environment and a postgreSQL database environment. -->

## Architecture
<!-- Our data lives in a postgreSQL schema and loads via linked SQL queries within our server.js file.  The user will eventually see the queried books on the client side via routes set up in this file. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

11-07-17 09:05am - Set up package.json, package-lock.json and fired up our server.

11-07-17 10:30 am - Set up scaffolding to take in client access and transmit information via routes which will bring the book data to the client.

11-07-17 12:30pm - Finalized loading methods to instantiate book data from our .json file.
